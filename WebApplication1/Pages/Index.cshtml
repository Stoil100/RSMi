            <p class="lead">
                Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. In web applications, 
                this typically involves checking credentials like usernames and passwords. Authentication ensures 
                that users are who they claim to be, which is crucial for maintaining the security of an application.

            <h3>2. User Registration</h3>
            <p>
                User registration is the process of creating a new account in the system. It typically involves 
                collecting user information, such as username, email, and password. The system stores this information 
                securely, often hashing the password before saving it to the database, to protect against unauthorized 
                access.

            <h3>3. User Login</h3>
            <p>
                User login is the process where a registered user provides their credentials to access the system.
                The system verifies the credentials by comparing them with stored data. Upon successful authentication,
                the system may create a session or issue a token to keep the user logged in during their interaction
                with the application.

            <h3>4. OAuth and External Providers</h3>
            <p>
                OAuth is a protocol that allows secure authorization from third-party services like Google, Facebook, 
                and others. Instead of handling user credentials directly, applications redirect users to the external 
                provider for authentication. This improves security and user convenience as they can use existing accounts 
                to log in to your application.
